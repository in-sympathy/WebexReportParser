Webex Attendance Processing Office Script

This Office Script automates Webex attendance reports by:

Adding “Training Duration” (default 90) and “Percentage” columns.
Converting the data into a table.
Cleaning and consolidating rows by summing durations (based on “Attendee Email”).
Inserting a live formula in “Percentage” so it updates dynamically.
Sorting by “Attendance Duration”, applying conditional formatting (red for <80%, green for ≥80%), and filtering rows by keywords in column D.
Auto-fitting columns and selecting the final dataset for easy copy.
Usage

Open your CSV in Excel for the web.
Enable Office Scripts and create a new script.
Copy-paste this script and run it.
Adjust defaults (e.g., Training Duration and keywords) as needed.
